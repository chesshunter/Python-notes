Let's do this. Woo.
# still comments out code. Always fun. Is this the case for all languages, or is it just common?
Print outputs text strings
A variable stores a piece of data, no matter what that piece is. 
Assigning thigns to variables is still <variable = thing>
From here on out I'm gonna try to mark example code with <>
Variables can store numbers, booleans, and other stuff I'm sure
I think typical style is to indent with four spaces. 
Is there a difference between indenting with four spaces and TAB with tab set to be 4 spaces?
Booleans have two possible values, true and false
In python, True is not the same thing as true. Which is weird I think but whatever.
ints and floats are still not the same thing. Latter has decimals, former does not. Can not. 
Python bits of code that are empty on the end will have None on a seperate line at the end of their output. 
Not sure what exactly constitutes it not being empty on the end.
Does printing something turn it into a string before outputting it, like Ruby does?
Re-assigning a variable still erases entirely what was there before, replacing it with the new assignation

In python, indented space has a function beyond stylistic. 
Indentation actually effects the running and functioning of code!
When indentation is wrong, an IndentationError will be thrown out (not sure if that's the right term?)
Functions are still a thing. I'll go over that later.
Functions don't automatically print or return anything. 
For functions to return anything upon being ran, the <return> keyword has to be actually used
comments are still made using #
Multi-line comments are done as such:
"""multi-line comment starts here
and continues
and continues
and ends
"""
Apparently it's also fine if the last set of quotation marks is on the same line as the last comment-line but whatever
I think I like coding in Ruby better, it felt a lot more... fluid, and such. But I suppose Python will be fun too once I learn it\
Basic math is still a thing. Following is assigning various variables from math <
addition_var = 2 + 3
subtraction_var = 11 - 3
multiplication_var = 11 * 5
division_var = 11 / 3>
As with ruby, a math expression is essentially in a parentheses, and ONLY the value that is returned from the parentheses as a 
whole matter s to the rest of the code. What fun what fun.
As always, numbers can be combined with other code objects to make more complex-programs.
Exponents and exponentation are still a thing, oh boy.
Both integers and floats can be exponentated <
print 2.5 ** 2>
yields 6.25
So as you can see this shit works yo. What fun
The exponentation sign is ** just like RUby
LJike in Ruby, the space between numbers and signs is optional, though recommended, and obviously the spaces between numbers are mandatory
modulo is still a thing, still returns the remainder from a division, still fun.
<print 3 % 2>
yields 1
Modulo is still fun, can still be used to determine if something is odd, even, prime (with a little work), all that fun stuff
Apparently codecademy has a pro version now, which has quizzes and the like. At least they didn't take anything form the free sections for it
Strings are generally marked with quotation marks, and are made up of letters, numbers, all that stuff
Pretty much any character available can be part of a string, and, unless modified, will not become active in any code-stuff near it.
That is to say, even if we have "False", it still won't be recognized by Python as a boolean, because it's a string
Escaping characters remains a thing, it's a way of making things be in strings that normally Python would recongnize as breaking the string
So to make the string "We haven't got all day!", we would have to put in the code:
<"We haven\'t got all day!">
Because escaping is generally done with a backslash, you see.
Like in Ruby, Python tracks the indexes of the characters in a string (and I'm assuming also in hashes and arrays and such)
Also like in Ruby (and I'm assuming every other language), tracking indices starts with 0, such that the first character's index is 0
So, for example, we could do the following things:
<string = "MONTY"
print string[3]
#would output "T"
print "MONTY"[1]
#Would output "O"
>
As you can see, the index of something is called using brackets.
This can also be done directly on the string, or on a variable holding the string
Remember that it's brackets, not parentheses! Parentheses are used for other things by python
String methods are methods used to mess with strings, and the stuff inside 'em
len() returns the length of a string. So:
variables essentially return whatever they're holding.
What this means is that we can also use an object wherever we'd normally use a variable holding the object. meaning we can do either 
<print len(string_var)
print len("string_var contents")>
either would print out the length of the string there
Oh, also, the parentheses after a method are where you put the method's target. Like above, the method acted upon the string_var variable
wow
I'm... not sure what the difference between object.method() and method(object) is, but... there is one.
Anyway!
lower() returns the string all lowercase
upper() returns the string all-caps
<string.lower()
#returns "string contents"
string.upper()
#returns "STRING CONTENTS">
str() turns non-strings into strings
non-strings can still be printed, I'm assuming that Python also turns non-strings into strings before printing them
methods that use dot notation only work within certain object classes.
.lower() for example, only works with strings, as it is a string method.
So.. there's the difference between them.
len() returns the length of anything, not just strings
Place where we write code is the editor
Console is where result of code is shown
Print displays code in the console (works on non-strings, but only by converting 'em to strings, so?)
Strings can still be combined using concantenation. 
It's basically like adding strings together. 
They're just... spliced end to end. There is NO automatic spacing, or arranging, or anything like that.
<print "spam " + "eggs"
#outputs "spam eggs">
Oh also concantenation is done with the plus sign. +. FYI
<print "spam " and "and " and "eggs"> Only outputs "eggs". I wonder why?
Concantenation does NOT work on non-strings. That is to say, python will not convert shit into strings just so you can concantenate.
Workaround, if you have shit you wanna concantenate that ain't strings: use str()
<print str(2) + " eggs"
#outputs "2 eggs">
wow
Wow let's do this again.
<%s%> places the contents of a variable into a string. Like this.
<print "This is %s land" % (variable)
#outputs "this is variablecontent land">
It also works more than once, wow
<print "This is %s and %s land" % (variable1, variable2)
#outputs "This is 1 and 2 land">
wow. This formatting is really stupid looking. Whatever.
The % operator after a string is used to combine that string with variables
Python does not require you to put a 0 in front of floats. So shit like .053 is fine
assignation stuff can still be done in a single line in more complicated ways than just var = stuff
<meal = meal + meal * texper>
Sets meal equal to itself plus itself times the percent of tax. Wow
This is a common feature but still bears writing down
Remember that variable assignations to not update!
That is to say, if early in a program we set <trees = 5>, and <forest = trees * 2>, then later change trees to <trees = 32>, forest will still be 10!
Time for more strings my dude!
Need the same number of % terms in a string as there are assigned after the string
raw_input takes the input provided to it (outputs a prompt at run-time), and returns that input as a string, which can then be assigned to a variable
it can have a prompt attached to it, like so
<inputvar = raw_input("prompt right here")>
this would output the prompt at run-time, then accept the provided input, then return the provided input, here storing it in inputvar
strings can be made either with double (") or single (') quotes, as well as this thing <str(stuff in the string)>. Not sure what's up with that last one
the python module datetime concerns the date and time. Obviously
It can be imported to a program by putting <from datetime import datetime> at the top of the program
I'm guessing that the first part of that tells python what we're importing from, and the latter part tells it what to import from it.
From that, can guess that python divides its libraries or whatever the term is into sections that make it necessary to specify what to import.
datetime.now() returns the current date and time as a string
.year .month and .day all return about what you'd expect as a string
Remember that programming is generally case-sensitive, so %S is NOT the same as %s
Alright, getting into some new stuff now. Woo!
Alright, let's do this! Control Flow!
The simplest aspect of control flow is comparators. They compare two different values, and return a true or false value depending on the compared things.
There are six comparators, which i think are roughly universal across languages.
== equal to, returns True if equal (works with strings and other stuff too), returns False if not. Note that comparator is ==, assignor is =
!= Not equal to, the inverse of ==
< Less than, returns True if the first value is less than the second, False if otherwise.
<= Less than or equal to, returns True if the first value is less than or equal to the second, False if otherwise.
> Greater than, returns True if the first value is greater than the second, False if otherwise
>= Greater than or equal to, returns True if the first value is greater than or equal to the second, False if otherwise
I'm not honestly sure how the greater/less than's interact with strings and stuff like that, but == and != just check if they're the same string
Oh, also, True and False are ALWAYS capitalized in Python. I'm not certain why, but it'll throw out errors if ya don't!
Comparations can also be made more advanced! By which I mean parentheses and the like are acceptable, more complicated than just one operation!
Somewhat simple example of that:
<<truevalvar = (38**2) + 2 > 5 * (12 * 4)>> wow
Boolean operators include And, Or, and Not
I'm capitalizing them here so they're seperate from other words, but they don't have to be capitalized in code (can't be, in fact)
And is a combinor: it combines two or more values, and ALL of them have to be true, or else the entire operation is False. 
<<True and False and True and True>> this returns False
Or is another combinor: it combines values, and only ONE of them has to be true to make the entire operation True.
<<True or False or False>> returns True
Not is an inverter: it essentially inverts whatever operation its attached to:
<<not True and True>> returns False        <<not False and False and True>> returns True
Generally, longer operations like these would make use of parentheses, even if that's not absolutely needed for the code to work. It just makes it easier to read!
It's useful to think in terms of binary, with True and False as 1's and 0's, And as multiplication, and Or as addition.
If you multiply 30 1's and a 0, then the result is still 0!
If you add 30 0's and a 1, the result is still 1! 
Slight caveat to that, though, is that every value greater than 1 is still basically 1 (multiple Trues is True)
A note outside the current context: You can use print to verify things in your code! 
That is, if you set something even midway through a long program, it will still print to the console, even if the program crashes later.
So, this could be used for a lot of things! Checking what a variable is storing, checking where exactly a program crashes (though the interpreter should tell you that...)
It's useful for a lot of things, and I wanted to write it down before I forgot!
The order of Boolean logic is don ein the same way as arithmetic. That is, it keeps in mind parentheses and brackets and the like.
It also has an order of operations, which follows the and-multiplication or-addition rules I mentioned earlier:
Not is first, And is second, and Or is last. 
So, negative signs, multiplication, then addition. Good way to think about it!
Ex: <<True or not False and False>> returns True.
Time for conditionals! Getting into real programming now!
If is a statement that executes some code IF the attached statement is true. Note that it doesn't NEED a then after it!
In place of where some languages (such as Ruby!) would use a Then, Python instead uses indented space!
Also, if statements need colons after them...? Not sure what's up with that yet!
Do remember that the code block after if statements can be longer than one line! It can be many!
Functions/methods in Python will NEVER return anything UNLESS you explicitly use the Return keyword! Bears repeating!
Else is a keyword we can add to an if statement. In the case that the attached statement is NOT true, the code attached to the Else will run.
Elif stands for "else if". It's like an Else statement, except with an attached condition.
This can be used for if we have multiple possible scenarios, but we want a different response to each one, instead of just If and Everything Else.
Elif will only be checked if the initial If is not true!
if-elif-else statements do NOT need End keywords, like in Ruby.
It would seem that Then and End are replaced by indentation. That's novel!
raw_input prompts the user at run-time, then returns the provided string. I covered it a bit earlier!
IF only counts actual true/false values, does not work with anything else! (I think Ruby considered strings and integers to be True)
.isalpha() returns True only if the string it's attached to does NOT contain numbers or anything like that.
I don't think there's any modifiers in Python for modifying a variable in place. In ruby could add exclamation mark to end to modify it then place it back in variable
It's possible to get slices of strings without using methods or anything (diff from rubY!)
string[1:4] will return the second through fifth characters of a string!
Remember that programming is flexible, so we can do things like this: string[1:len(string)]
That's interesting.
Now we're getting into functions
A method is a function within a class. 
It's often simpler to write a function when a block of code is going to be reused often. 
If I remember correctly, it's somewhat slower at runtime because the computer has to go back to find the function, THEN run it.
But... I think that's worth it, so we don't have to write out the same block of code 5 times.
Functions are defined with three parts.
The header: includes the DEF keyword which begins everything, the function's name, and any parameters it may have.
A parameter is something that will be put into the code whenever the function is used, so as to make the function more flexible.
<<def function(parameter)>> That's what the header will look like
Generally, it's good to include a comment after the header which states what the function is supposed to do.
The body of the function is the code that the function runs, and is indented. 
Once again, python doesn't use an End keyword, it just uses indentation.
As usual, the header must conclude with a colon. Putting it all together, we get:
<<def function():
  code goes here
rest of program continues>> #what fun
Huh. You can put comments off to the side of the rest of the code       #like this
Things printed inside a function will still be output to the console
Parameters are used to add flexibility to a function. Here's a simple example 
<<def addition(number, number2)
  return number + number2
addition(2, 8)>> # this would return 10, cuz 2 + 8 = 10
The parameter is defined within the function when it's first defined, arguments are passed in when the function is later called.
In the above example, number and number2 are parameters, while 2 and 8 are arguments.
Functions can also call each other, which is probably useful.
<<def one_good_turn(n):
    return n + 1
    
def deserves_another(n):
    return one_good_turn(n) + 2>>
A poor example I took right out of the codecademy class. That's right, I'm plagiarizing and I don't even care.
There's a python module called Math that includes a lot of basic math functions and methods and stuff.
We can import it, and other included modules, using import.
To use functions and such from modules, we usually have to include the module's name when calling them, so that PYthon knows where to call from.
So, to use the square root function from Math, we'd:
<<import math
math.sqrt(25)>> #bang, we just used the sqrt function. Wow.
You can also import specific functions from modules:
<<from math import sqrt>> We can now use the sqrt function from moth, without importing the whole module
This follows the form <<from module import function>>
If we want to import everything from the math module, but just have it be temporarily in Python, so we don't have to add math. to functions, we:
from math import *
This can be a bad idea, however, as it imports all the functions of math right into your program, without them being associated with a module.
So, for example, if we had a sqrt() before importing, our function would get replaced with math's sqrt()!
While that doesn't sound too bad, it's a problem that can be very bad in large-scale programming, because you have a LOT of work laying around, and you don't want it getting overwritten!
if we just import math module itself, though, we're safe, because we then have both sqrt() AND math.sqrt()
biggest_number()  smallest_number()  and distance_from_zero()  are all built-in functions, and do about what you would expect.
max() returns the largest argument from a set of arguments. 
Python seems to do odd things when comparing strings... It seems to usually count shorter strings as the larger?
min(), unsurprisingly, returns the smallest argument of the provided set.
abs() returns the absolute value of its argument.
IMportant
type() returns the type of argument it receives. IE: string, int, float, etc. 
type("whoa") returns <type 'str'>
I'm... not sure what that ^ thing is.
Lists are another type of data. Datatype.
There are other datatypes we know about, like the string, booleans, and integers.
Lists can be created using an expression that looks like this:
<<list_name = [item1, item2, item3...]
Lists SEEM to just be one-dimensional arrays, from what I can tell... Which, if they behave similarly to Ruby, means they can contain
any sort of datatype, as well as containing multiple types in the same room.
items in lists have indexes (indices), just like the characters in strings. 
Items in lists can be individually accessed just like the indiv. characters in strings, too. Syntax:
<<list_name[2]>> would call the third item from the list (they start at zero, just like everything else)
Lists can be created empty, obviously.
List indexes act somewhat like variables, in that they can be assigned.
So, for example, if animal_list contains strings with the names of 5 animals, we can put <<animal_list[2] = "tinger">>
That will change the third item in the list to be the string "tinger". 
However, if we try to assign a value that doesn't already exist, then Python will throw out an error.
Assigning like this can NOT be used to add length to the list, only to replace what's already there. 
What CAN add length to it, though, is the .append method (among others, obviously)
just slap it on the end of a list with an argument, and it will add that argument to the end of the list.
We can also take out slices of a list, without relying on a method (like one would have to in Ruby)
The syntax for that has basically already been covered, but here it is again:
<<list_name[0:2]>> this would return a list containing the first and second items in list_name.
This is because the slice goes up to the index after the colon, but does NOT include the index after the colon
Strings are BASICALLY just lists of characters. How silly's that.
You can leave the after-colon index off, and it will go from the first index to the end. EG:
<<animals[5:]>> would return the fifth through last indexes of the list. Nice
You can also leave off the first, producing roughly the opposite effect, the first index up to the after-colon one.
the .index method searches through a list (or prolly a string or array too), and returns the index of the first item matching the provided argument
<<["cat", "dog", "animal", "eggplant", "bat", 32, True].index("bat")>> would return 4, as that's the first index at which an item matching "bat" can be found
the .insert method inserts a provided item at the provided index, moving everything else down to fit it.
Oh god we're getting into loops
Loops are iterators, generally used to do a lot of stuff, with much less code than going through and typing it all manually.
the for loop is a pretty simple one, and applies the same operation to all items of a list (well, unless you modified it with if/else or soemthing...)
the basic syntax is thus:
<<for variable in list_name:>> #the variable is the one assigned within the loop to the item modified with each iteration.
list_name is the modified or affected list, obviously.
The .sort() method sorts the contents of a list, according to magnitude. Thus, a list of integers and/or floats would be sorted in least to greatest.
Booleans... True is probably one and False is probably 0
Strings are... weird. I'm honestly not sure at all how sorting them works...
Dictionaries are basically hashes from Ruby, I'm guessing.
Basically, it's like a list, but instead of automatically assigned indices, each item has a key, which can be a string or number (just like a hash!)
Each pair of item and key is called a key-value pair (also, the things I'm calling items are normally called values)
Accessing items is just like with a list, except instead of an index we put in a key.
Be careful when using keys that are strings, cuz they have to be spelled and capitalized correctly!
Dictionaries are very handy, and useful for a lot of things, ya know?
A pair of empty curly braces is an empty dictionary.
That is to say, a dictionary has curly braces, list has braces
empty_dictionary = {}
New values can be added to dictionaries like assigning new items to lists, except that the newly-provided key can be anything. Nifty
<<dictionary["key23"] = True>> just assigned some stuff to be true. 
Like hashes, you can put lists inside dictionaries, making them no longer 1-dimensional.
Values in dictionaries can be just straight-up deleted with the del keyword.
<<del dict_name[key]>> removes the provided key and its value from the dictionary
Can use ; (a semicolon) in place of a line break. So
<<print "good" ; print "bad">> is the same as 
<<print "good"
print"bad">> How interesting right
.remove(item) removes the first item that matches the argument from a list. 
This is basically the same as using del list_name[index], but it's a bit simpler since we don't have to find the index of the thing we want deleted.
my_dict = {
    "fish": ["c", "a", "r", "p"],
    "cash": -4483,
    "luck": "good"
}
Here's an example of a multi-dimensional dictionary. Notice that "fish" contains a list. What's interesting is that we can still access the list itself, just a bit more complex:
<<print my_dict["fish"][1]>> This would output the letter "a", the second letter in the fish list. Wow, nifty
This is a good example of a programming concept: even if things don't LOOK like they're completely equivalent, they still are.
Eg, we can apply .index() to a list in a variable, AND a list that's just been created (<<["fish", 2].index("fish")>>, for example)
Note that dictionaries aren't really ordered, normally, so iterating through them will likely be in unpredictable orders.
Dot notation is for class methods. That is, methods that specifically are for objects of a certain class.
Hence, .sort() works with lists, but nothing else, because it is a method of the list class.
Similarly, upper() works only with strings beacuse it is a string method.
Other things, like len(), work with many types of objects, and thus NEVER use dot notation.
Note the notation for creating a new dictionary with stuff in it. It's handy.
Element is a word for an item in a list, dictionary, or anything like that. So the first item in a list would be the first element. Ye
.pop(index) removes the element at the provided index, as well asw returns it. 
.remove(item) removes the provided item from a list (works like the .index(), by searching for the provided item. Except here it removes it)
del(list_name[1]) will remove the item at the provided index, but not return it.
At any time, a function or method may be modified. This includes methods and functions built into python!
Though, that said, it should be noted that, to modify CLASS methods, one must first enter the method (through a process I don't know in python yet)
Doing things inside of a function is generally no different from doing them anywhere else.
I'm not exactly sure if the control location stuff from Ruby is in effect in Python.
range(x,y) returns a list of numbers starting at x and ending at y, by increments of 1 (so far as I can tell)(
Do remember that you can increment through each element in a list using for x in List_Name. 
You could also do this, if you like really needed to.
<<def double_list(x):
    for i in range(0, len(x)):
        x[i] = x[i] * 2
    return x>>
This second method is much more useful if we need to modify the list, because it works using indexes.
As stated, range() is used to generate lists. Bit more complicated than I htought tho!
<<range(6) => [0,1,2,3,4,5] #range(stop), stopping at the number before provided stopping point (basically a list with x elements)
range(1,6) => [1,2,3,4,5] #range(start, stop)
range(1,6,3) => [1,4] #range(start, stop, step), step being the difference between consecutive elements. 3, in this case.
Remember +=? It's a thing in Python too, and so are its brethren:
+= 
-=
*=
/=
combines something (int or float) with the contents of a variable, then stores the result in the variable
5 += VariableContainingSix => VariableContainingSix == 11
These are useful when taking totals, or anything like that. Basically, interactions between variables and numbers.
adding * (int), where int is a number, can make certain commands repeat, like print.
.join is used to combine the contents of a list into a string. 
It does so in a somewhat odd manner, as shown here:
<<letters = ['A', 'B', 'C']
print "-".join(letters)>>
This outputs 'A-B-C', which is the result of combining the items in the letters list with a '-' between them.
